# Early_sepsis_detection
Early Prediction of Sepsis from Clinical Data

The notebook was worked by using the clinical data from the PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019.

**Objective**: Sepsis detection by using machine learning models based on the physiological data. Particularly, we design and implement a working, open-source algorithm that can, based only on the clinical data provided, automatically identify a patient's risk of sepsis and make a positive or negative prediction of sepsis.

You can dowload data directly from the website and try the code on jupiter notebook. 

Have a nice time of studying!
